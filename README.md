# KPMG-VIrtyal-Internship

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s 
Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, 
Information & Modelling team. However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that 
“the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. 
The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months
